                <h4>I am Vuyiseka Njovane the Founder and Executive Director of Organic Cosmetic Wholesale. I have struggled with acne for all my teen years right into my early 20s, having have tried different brands that people recommended and switching between them was such a horrific experience, you can imagine. Until one day I decided to carry out some research and found some really helpful information on how I can make organic products for my acne-prone skin
                    then I started using organic products on my face that i had prepared myself and never looked back. 
                    My skin has been recovering since and i couldnâ€™t be happier. 
                    This is when and how Organic Cosmetic Wholesale came to life, i have a desire to help many people suffering with the same skin conditions throughout the universe with my organic products </h4>
